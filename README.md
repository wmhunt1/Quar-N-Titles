Original Repo found at: https://github.com/mlanglois333/Quarantine-Accomplishments

This application is designed to help the user log and keep track of movies, tv shows, and books
they have watched and read over the course of the pandemic. When a title is searched, the 
title and relevant information will be displayed for the user, who can then decide to add 
it to their list.

This application uses a single HTML page and a single JS file, with most elements being created dynamically. Our css is powered by a modified version of Tailwind. Our back-end is powered by Jquery and uses the following API's to retrieve information:

OMDB - Movie Database
TMDB - Television Database
OpenLibrary- Books Database

The titles are stored in local storage so they will remain saved on the users device unless they would like to remove it.
